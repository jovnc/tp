## Introduction

PlayBook is a **desktop application for semi-professional youth football coaches** to manage player contacts, track injuries, and organize their teams.

#### Who should use PlayBook?

PlayBook is designed for semi-professional youth football coaches who:

- Manage multiple teams
- Familiar with football terminology (positions, injuries)
- Track 20-50+ players across different age groups
- Need quick access to player availability, positions, captaincy and injury status
- Prefer typing commands over navigating complex GUIs

No coding experience required. Commands use simple English keywords like `add`, `delete`, `list`, and `filter`.

#### Why PlayBook?

Traditional contact apps weren't built for coaching. PlayBook solves common team management challenges:

- **Find available players instantly** - `filter tm/U16 i/FIT ps/ST` shows all fit strikers on your U16 team in one command
- **Update records in seconds** - Record an injury, assign a captain, or change positions without clicking through menus
- **No internet dependency** - Access your full roster offline during matches, training sessions, or team selection
- **Complete team overview** - Track positions, injuries, captaincy, and contact details in one application

---

## Quick start

Follow these steps to install PlayBook and add your first player.

#### 1. Verify Java installation

PlayBook requires Java 17 or above. Check your version by running:

```
java --version
```

If you need to install Java:

- **macOS**: [Installation guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html)
- **Windows**: [Installation guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html)
- **Linux**: [Installation guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html)

#### 2. Download PlayBook

Download the latest `playbook.jar` from our [releases page](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/releases).

Save it to a dedicated folder (e.g., `Documents/PlayBook`). PlayBook will create data files in this location.

#### 3. Launch the application

Navigate to your PlayBook folder and run:

```bash
# Navigate to your folder (example paths)
cd ~/Documents/PlayBook          # macOS/Linux
cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents\PlayBook    # Windows

# Launch PlayBook
java -jar playbook.jar
```

The PlayBook window should open with sample data loaded.

#### 4. Understanding the interface

The PlayBook interface consists of:

| Component          | Description                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Command Box**    | Enter commands here. Press Enter to execute.                         |
| **Result Display** | Shows command feedback, success messages, and error details.         |
| **List View**      | Displays players, teams, or positions based on your current command. |
| **Detail Cards**   | Shows complete information for each item in the list.                |

The PlayBook comes with 3 unique panels that can be toggled between each other via commands.

**Players view:**

![playersViewUi](images/playersViewUi.png)

**Teams view:**

![teamsViewUi](images/teamsViewUi.png)

**Positions view:**

![positionsViewUi](images/positionsViewUi.png)

#### 5. Try your first commands

Type each command in the Command Box and press Enter.

**Clear sample data:**

```
clear
```

**Expected result:** PlayBook displays "PlayBook has been cleared!" and the list becomes empty.

**Create a team:**

```
addteam tm/U16
```

**Expected result:** "New team added: U16"

**Add a player:**

```
add pl/Alex Tan p/87654321 e/alex@example.com a/123 Main St tm/U16
```

**Expected result:** Alex Tan's player card appears in the list with all details displayed. The result display shows the confirmation message with player information.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** You must create the team (U16) first before adding players to it.
</box>

**View all players:**

```
list
```

**Expected result:** All players in your PlayBook are displayed in the list view.

#### Next steps

You're now ready to manage your teams. Common tasks include:

- **Add positions**: `addposition ps/LW`
- **Assign positions**: `assignposition pl/Alex Tan ps/LW`
- **Record injuries**: `assigninjury pl/Alex Tan i/Ankle sprain`
- **Filter players**: `filter i/FIT` (show only fit players)
- **Get help**: `help`

For complete documentation of all commands, see the [Features](#features) section below.

## Command Reference

This section explains how to read and use commands in PlayBook.

### Command Format Conventions

<box type="info" seamless>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add pl/PLAYER_NAME`, `PLAYER_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add pl/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>

  - e.g `pl/PLAYER_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `pl/John Doe t/friend` or as `pl/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `pl/PLAYER_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER pl/PLAYER_NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
  </box>

### Global Feature Behaviours

1. **Team creation and deletion commands**:

   - Automatically switches to the `Viewing Teams` panel (if not already in that view).

2. **Position creation and deletion commands**:

   - Automatically switches to the `Viewing Positions` panel (if not already in that view).

3. **Player-related commands**: (`add`, `edit`, `delete`, `assign`, `unassign`, `filter`)
   - Automatically switches to the `Viewing Players` panel (if not already in that view).

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes:**

- The view switches **only after the command succeeds**. If the command fails, the current view remains unchanged and an error message is displayed.
- Refer to the respective list section for the detailed behaviour of each type of list command.

</box>

### Field Requirements

The following requirements apply to all commands unless otherwise specified:

**Player Name (`PLAYER_NAME`):**

- Should contain alphanumeric characters and spaces only
- Should not be blank
- Is case-insensitive (e.g., `john doe` is the same as `John Doe`)

**Team Name (`TEAM_NAME`):**

- Should contain alphanumeric characters and spaces only
- Should not be blank
- Is case-insensitive (e.g., `u16` is the same as `U16`)

**Position Name (`POSITION_NAME`):**

- Should contain only alphanumeric characters, with no spaces
- Should not be blank
- Is case-insensitive (e.g., `fw` is the same as `FW`)

**Phone Number (`PHONE_NUMBER`):**

- Should only contain numbers
- Should be at least 3 digits long
- Should not be blank

**Email (`EMAIL`):**

- Should be a valid email format (e.g., `john@example.com`)
- Should not be blank

**Address (`ADDRESS`):**

- Should not be blank

**Injury (`INJURY`):**

- Should contain alphanumeric characters and spaces only
- Should not be blank
- Is case-insensitive (e.g., `acl` is the same as `ACL`)

**Tag (`TAG`):**

- Should contain alphanumeric characters only
- Is case-sensitive (e.g., `Friend` is different from `friend`)

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note on Team and Position Names:**

When you create a team or position, PlayBook stores the exact capitalization you first use. All future references to that team or position (regardless of how you type it) will use this original capitalization.

**Example:**

- If you create `addteam tm/u16`, the team is stored as "u16"
- Later commands like `add pl/John tm/U16` or `assignteam pl/John tm/U16` will work (case-insensitive matching)
- But John's team will be displayed as "u16" (the original capitalization)

The same applies to positions: if you create `addposition ps/LW`, all players assigned to that position will show "LW" even if you type `assignposition pl/John ps/lw`.

</box>

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** A player can have any number of tags (including 0). Use tags to mark players as "scholarship", "youth", "newcomer", etc.
</box>

**Examples:**

- `PLAYER_NAME` must not already be assigned to `TEAM_NAME`.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Important: Captain Status Removal**

When a player who is captain of their current team is reassigned to a new team, they will **automatically lose their captain status**.
This prevents having multiple captains in the same team.
You will be notified when this happens, and you can reassign captaincy using the `assigncaptain` command if needed.
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Use this command when promoting players between age groups (e.g., moving a player from U16 to U18) or reassigning players to different squads.
</box>

**Examples:**

1. `assignteam pl/John Doe tm/U16` - Moves John Doe to the U16 team
2. `assignteam pl/Betsy Crowe tm/U18` - Moves Betsy Crowe to the U18 team

- **For non-captain players:** "Player: John Doe has been successfully assigned to Team: U16!"

- **For captain players:** "Player: John Doe has been successfully assigned to Team: U16!<br>John Doe has been stripped of captaincy from their previous team."

**Expected behaviour:** The player's team will be immediately updated in their player card, and if they were a captain, the captain badge will be removed.

![teamUi](images/teamUi.png)

</box>

#### Assigning a position to player: `assignposition`

Assigns an existing position to an existing player in the PlayBook.

Format: `assignposition pl/PLAYER_NAME ps/POSITION_NAME`

**Requirements:**

- `PLAYER_NAME` must be an existing player in the PlayBook.

**Warning:** You must create the position first using `addposition` before assigning it to players. If the position doesn't exist, you'll get an error message.
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Players can be assigned multiple positions. Use this feature to track versatile players who can play in different roles.
</box>

**Examples:**

1. `assignposition pl/John Doe ps/LW` - Assigns `LW` position to John Doe
2. `assignposition pl/Musiala ps/ST` - Assigns `ST` position to Musiala

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected success message** (Example 1): "John Doe has been successfully assigned position LW!"

![positionUi](images/positionUi.png)

</box>

#### Assign an injury to player: `assigninjury`

Assigns an injury status to an existing player in the PlayBook.

Format: `assigninjury pl/PLAYER_NAME i/INJURY`

**Requirements:**

- `PLAYER_NAME` must be an existing player in the PlayBook.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:** The keyword `FIT` (in any letter case) is not allowed as a valid injury status. Use `unassigninjury` instead to restore the player's injury status to `FIT`.
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**

- Players can sustain multiple concurrent injuries. Simply use `assigninjury` multiple times with different injury names.
- Use specific injury names (e.g., "ACL", "hamstring strain", "ankle sprain") for better injury tracking.
- After assigning an injury, use `listinjured` to view all injured players at a glance.
  </box>

**Examples:**

1. `assigninjury pl/John Doe i/ACL` - Marks John Doe with an ACL injury status
2. `assigninjury pl/Musiala i/fibula fracture` - Marks Musiala with a fibula fracture injury status
3. `assigninjury pl/John Doe i/hamstring strain` - Assigns a second injury status, hamstring strain, to John Doe

<box type="info" seamless>

![injuryUi](images/injuryUi.png)

</box>

#### Assigning player as captain: `assigncaptain`

Assigns an existing player in the PlayBook to be captain.

Format: `assigncaptain pl/PLAYER_NAME`

**Requirements:**

- `PLAYER_NAME` must be an existing player in the PlayBook.
- The player must not already be an assigned captain.
- **Only one captain per team is allowed** - when you assign a new captain to a team that already has a captain, the previous captain will automatically be stripped of their captaincy.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**

- Each team can have only one captain at a time. If you assign a new captain, the old captain will be automatically removed.
- Use `listcaptain` to see all current team captains.
- **Captain status is team-specific**: If a captain is reassigned to a different team using `assignteam`, they will automatically lose their captain status. You'll need to use `assigncaptain` again if you want them to be captain of their new team.
  </box>

**Examples:**

1. `assigncaptain pl/John Doe` - Assigns John Doe as captain.
2. `assigncaptain pl/Sergio Ramos` - Assigns Sergio Ramos as captain. Unassigns the previous captain.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected success message** (Example 1): "John Doe is now captain of U16"

**Expected behaviour:** A captain badge will appear on the player's card.

![captainUi](images/captainUi.png)

</box>

#### Deleting a player, team or position: `delete`

Deletes the specified player, team or position from the PlayBook.

Format: `delete [pl/PLAYER_NAME] [tm/TEAM_NAME] [ps/POSITION_NAME]`

Consider making a backup of your data file before bulk deletions.
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The command can only delete one player, team or position at a time.
</box>

**Examples:**

1. `delete pl/John Doe` - Permanently deletes player John Doe from PlayBook
2. `delete tm/U16` - Deletes the U16 team from PlayBook (only if no players are assigned)
3. `delete ps/LW` - Deletes LW position from PlayBook

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected success message:**

**For player deletion** (Example 1): "Player: John Doe; Phone: 98765432; Email: johnd@example.com; Address: John street, block 123, #01-01; Team: U16; Position: LW; Injuries: [ACL]; Captain Status: Active; Tags: ; has been deleted successfully!"

- **Expected behaviour:** The player card will immediately disappear from the player list.

Format: `unassigninjury pl/PLAYER_NAME i/INJURY`

**Requirements:**

- `PLAYER_NAME` must be an existing player in the PlayBook.
- `INJURY` must match an injury status that is already assigned to the specified player.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:** The player must not already have the default `FIT` status.
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**

- If the player has multiple injuries, removing one injury will keep the others. Only when all injuries are removed will the injury status return to `FIT`.
- The injury name must match exactly (case-insensitive) with what was assigned to the specified player.
- Use `listinjured` to check the current injury statuses before unassigning.
  </box>

**Examples:**

1. `unassigninjury pl/John Doe i/ACL` - Removes the ACL injury status from John Doe
2. `unassigninjury pl/Musiala i/fibula fracture` - Removes the fibula fracture injury status from Musiala

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected success message** (Example 1): "John Doe's ACL injury status has been removed!"

**Expected behaviour:** If the player has no other injury status, their status will automatically return to the default "FIT" status.

</box>

#### Unassigning player as captain: `unassigncaptain`

Removes captain status from an existing player in the PlayBook.

Format: `unassigncaptain pl/PLAYER_NAME`

**Requirements:**

- The player must already be an assigned captain.

**Examples:**

1. `unassigncaptain pl/John Doe` - Removes captain status from John Doe
2. `unassigncaptain pl/Sergio Ramos` - Removes captain status from Sergio Ramos

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected success message** (Example 1): "John Doe is no longer team captain."

**Expected behaviour:** The captain badge will be removed from the player's card.

</box>

#### Editing a player: `edit`

Edits an existing player in the PlayBook. Existing values will be updated to the input values.

Format: `edit pl/PLAYER_NAME [n/NEW_PLAYER_NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

**Requirements:**

- At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
- `PLAYER_NAME` must be an existing player in the PlayBook.
- `NEW_PLAYER_NAME` must not be the same as an existing player in the PlayBook.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warnings:**

- When editing tags, all existing tags will be replaced with the new ones. If you want to keep existing tags, you must include them in the edit command.
- You cannot edit team, injury status, position, or captain status through this command - use `assignteam`, `assigninjury`, `assignposition`, or `assigncaptain` commands instead.
  </box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**

- You can edit multiple fields at once (e.g., both phone and email).
- To remove all tags, use `t/` without any tag names after it.
- Edit accepts a combination of unchanged and updated fields, provided that the entered values meet the stated requirements. It will update only the fields that differ. However, it does not allow all fields to be unchanged.
  </box>

**Examples:**

**Expected behaviour:** The player card will immediately display all newly updated field changes.

</box>

#### Locating players by name: `find`

Finds players whose names contain any of the given keywords provided.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

**Requirements:**

- Keywords will only match full words e.g. `John` will not match `Johnny`.
- Players matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `John Bo` will return `John Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.

**Warnings:**

- Duplicate keywords are not allowed when using the command.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**

- Use `find` when you remember part of a player's name but not their full name.
- To return to the view of all players after a search, use the `list` command.
- For more advanced filtering by team, position, or injury status, use the `filter` command.
  </box>

**Examples:**

1. `find John` - Returns players named "John Doe" and "John Smith"
2. `find alex david` - Returns "Alex Yeo" and "David Li" (matches either keyword)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected success message:** "X persons listed!" where X is the number of players matching either of the keyword(s).

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Use this to quickly see all the teams you have created. Helpful for verifying team names before adding new players.
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected behaviour:** A list of all the team names will be displayed in the `Viewing Teams` panel (e.g., "U16, U18, Reserves").

</box>

#### Listing all positions: `listposition`

Shows a list of the all positions in the PlayBook.

Format: `listposition`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Use this to check which positions you have already created before assigning positions to players.
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected behaviour:** A list of all position names will be displayed in the `Viewing Positions` panel (e.g., "LW, ST, GK, MF").

</box>

#### Listing all injured players: `listinjured`

Shows a list of all the injured players in the PlayBook.

Format: `listinjured`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**

- Use this command before match day to quickly see who is unavailable.
- Combine the result with team information in the player cards to see which teams are affected by injuries.
- This shows all the players with any injury status other than "FIT".
  </box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected behaviour:** Only players with injuries (non-FIT status) will be displayed in the `Viewing Players` panel. Their injury details can be viewed on their player cards.

</box>

#### Filtering players by team, injury, position: `filter`

Filter players by team, injury and/or position.

Format: `filter [tm/TEAM_NAME] [i/INJURY] [ps/POSITION_NAME]`

**Requirements:**

- At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
- `TEAM_NAME` must be an existing team in the PlayBook. Use the `addteam` command to add a team first.
- `POSITION_NAME` must be an existing position in the PlayBook. Use the `addposition` command to add a position first.
- `TEAM_NAME`, `INJURY`, and `POSITION_NAME` use exact whole-field string matching (i.e. `AND` search).
  - e.g., `filter i/Broken Leg` returns only players whose `INJURY` is `Broken Leg` or `broken leg` (case-insensitive)
  - e.g., `filter tm/Manchester United` returns only players whose `TEAM_NAME` is `Manchester United` or `manchester United` (case-insensitive)

**Warnings:**

- `POSITION_NAME` cannot be `NONE` when filtering by position.
- For `TEAM_NAME` and `POSITION_NAME`, only leading and trailing spaces will be trimmed, any spaces in the name will be used for exact matching.
  - e.g., `John Doe` will match `   John Doe` but not match `John     Doe`.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**

- **Pre-match planning**: Use `filter tm/U16 i/FIT` to see all the available U16 players.
- **Position planning**: Use `filter ps/ST i/FIT` to find all the fit strikers across teams.
- **Injury tracking**: Use `filter tm/U18 i/ACL` to see all the U18 players with ACL injuries.
- Combine multiple filters for precise results. All conditions must be met (`AND` logic).
  </box>

**Examples:**

1. `filter tm/U16 ps/FW` - Shows the U16 players who play Forward
2. `filter ps/FW tm/U17 i/FIT` - Shows the fit Forwards from U17 team
3. `filter i/Leg Broken ps/MF` - Shows the Midfielders with a leg broken injury
4. `filter tm/Chelsea` - Shows all the Chelsea team players
5. `filter tm/Manchester United i/Leg Broken` - Shows all the Manchester United team players with their leg broken

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected success message:** "X persons listed!" where X is the number of players matching all the filtering criteria(s).

**Expected behaviour:** Only the matching players will be displayed.

#### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Clears all entries from the PlayBook.

Format: `clear`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**WARNING: IRREVERSIBLE ACTION!**

This command will permanently delete:

- All players and their information
- All teams
- All positions
- All assignments (injuries, captaincy, etc.)

**There is no undo.** Make sure you have a backup of your data file (located under `/data/playbook.json`) before using this command!
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Use this command at the start of a new season to begin with a clean slate, but always backup your previous season's data first.

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected success message:** "Playbook has been cleared!"

**Expected behaviour:** The player list panel will be completely empty.
</box>

#### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected behaviour:** The PlayBook application window will close immediately. Your data is safely stored in `playbook.json`.
</box>

#### Saving the data

PlayBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Find your data at `/data/playbook.json`

</box>

#### Editing the data file

PlayBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `/data/playbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**

- If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, PlayBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
- Always make a backup of the file before editing it manually.
- Certain edits can cause PlayBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range).
- Only edit the data file if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
  </box>

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?**<br>
**A:** Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous PlayBook home folder.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally delete a player?**<br>
**A:** Unfortunately, there's no undo feature.

**Q: Can a player be in multiple teams?**<br>
**A:** No, each player can only be assigned to one team at a time. If you need to move a player to a different team, use the `assignteam` command.

**Q: What happens to a captain when they change teams?**<br>
**A:** When a captain is reassigned to a new team using `assignteam`, they automatically lose their captain status. This prevents having multiple captains on the same team. You will receive a notification message when this happens. If you want them to be captain of their new team, use the `assigncaptain` command after the team change.

**Q: How do I quickly find all available players for a match?**<br>
**A:** Use the `filter i/FIT` command to show only players with no injuries. You can combine this with team filtering: `filter tm/U16 i/FIT` to see all fit players in the U16 team.

**Q: Can I track multiple injuries for a player?**<br>
**A:** Yes! Players can sustain multiple concurrent injuries. Use `assigninjury` multiple times for different injuries, and use `unassigninjury` to remove specific injuries when they recover.

**Q: What if I make a typo in a player's name?**<br>
**A:** Use the `edit` command to correct it. For example: `edit pl/Jon Doe n/John Doe` will rename "Jon Doe" to "John Doe".

**Q: Why can't I delete a team?**<br>
**A:** Teams can only be deleted if they have no players assigned. First reassign all players to other teams using `assignteam`, or delete the players, then delete the team using `deleteteam`.

**Q: Does PlayBook work offline?**<br>
**A:** Yes! PlayBook works completely offline and stores all data locally on your computer.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen.
   - **Remedy**: delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear.
   - **Remedy**: manually restore the minimized Help Window
3. **Due to Playbook's case-insensitive name matching system**, names like `john doe` and `John Doe` are treated as the same player.
   - **Problem**: editing a name only to change its capitalisation, such as `edit pl/john doe n/John Doe`, will fail because the system does not consider capitalisation-only modifications to be meaningful
   - **Remedy**: temporarily rename the player to a different name with `edit pl/john doe n/Temp Name`, then re-edit it back to the correct capitalisation using `edit pl/Temp Name n/John Doe`
4. **Playbook's duplicate detection** treats names with different spacing as different entries.
   - **Example**: `Alex Yeoh`, `AlexYeoh`, and `Alex  Yeoh` (double-spacing) are all considered separate players, which can create unintended duplicate entries due to spacing variations
   - **Remedy**: ensure the player name is entered with the exact spacing you intend
5. **Incorrect or misplaced prefixes** may be parsed as part of the value for the nearest preceding valid prefix, if one exists.
   - **Example**: `assigninjury pl/John Doe i/ACL tm/U16` — invalid `tm/` prefix for `assigninjury` is interpreted as part of the injury value, causing an invalid injury error rather than an invalid prefix error
   - **Remedy**: follow the exact command format for each command and use only the correct prefixes
6. **Strict validation rules** are enforced for certain player fields, meaning inputs that deviate from the expected format are rejected.
   - **Example**: Phone number accepts only digits — you can enter multiple phone numbers only if they are entered as a continuous string of digits because spaces or special characters like (`-`, `+`, `)`, etc.) are rejected
     - An input like `1234 5678 (HP) 1111-3333 (Office)` will be rejected and triggers an error message to notify you of this behaviour
   - **Remedy**: provide a single phone number—typically the player's personal number or their designated emergency contact—using digits only, which is sufficient to satisfy the functional needs of Playbook users
